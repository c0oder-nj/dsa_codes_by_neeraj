object --> object is a real world entity that has some state or behaviour 
why it is called real world entity

in oops things revolves around object many benefits we have using this


class --> class is an bluepritn for an object
class is a user defined data type user banata hai 


object is an instance of class


access class properties and methods using .operator

--> **Acess Modifiers**
--> Public --> can be used anywhere inside and outside the class
--> Private --> data variable and functions can only be used inside the class
--> Protected
--> default sab kuchh private hota hai apko pehle public specify krna hoga



--> **Getter and Setter functions**
--> these functions are used to get and set the private data variables of class


--> **Constructor**
--> whenever we creates an object constructor is called 
--> invokes at the time of object creation
--> no input parameter 
--> no return type
--> constructor name is same as class name

--> we have a default constructor e.g. 
Hero Ramesh;
jab mene likha toh default constructor kuchh aise call hoga jo ki hoga 
Ramesh.Hero() ; here .Hero() is my default constructor

--> we have parameteries constructor, constructor me parameter pass krdo
